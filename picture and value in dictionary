There is dictionaries, that contain picture name as key, and value is the label data from that picture
define a function called pics_to_tuples that takes in dictionary, and returns dictionary where keys are labels and
values are tuples of picture names, that contained that label



Solutions:

def pics_to_tuples(dict_in):
    # normally I would go for sets and .values(), but we didn't learn those so..
    # this will be bit ugly, but uses only things you know how to use
    # first we check how many labels
    labels = []
    for key in dict_in:
        #print(k)
        #print(dict_in[key])
        if dict_in[key] in labels:
            continue
        else:
            labels.append(dict_in[key])
    #Then we make new dictionaries based on labels
    dict_to_return = {}
    for label in labels:
        dict_to_return[label] = []
    #test where label is same, and append picture to that list
    for key_in in dict_in:
        for key_re in dict_to_return:
            if dict_in[key_in] == key_re:
                dict_to_return[key_re].append(key_in)
    #finally make all the list to tuples
    for key in dict_to_return:
        dict_to_return[key] = tuple(dict_to_return[key])

    return dict_to_return
